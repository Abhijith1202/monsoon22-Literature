# Readings (Broken Love)
## Text (contd.)
The "sun's broken yolk at evening" describes the end of a day, which parallels (presumably) the end of the relationship. It is possible that it is a sexual metaphor, relying on the climactic symbolism of egg yolks.

The last two lines draw a connection between his own feelings and his surroundings – he is *externalising* the emotion. It can also be seen as containing, or consuming him.  
Here, the shift in tone to a more literal, straightforward expression represents the poet subverting the expectations brought on by the figurative and metaphorical words throughout the poem.

This poem is an example of *creative distance* – describing one's own experiences by fictionalising them or representing them in a different way.

# Readings (Secunderabad Sans Light)
## Text
This poem makes use of electricity as a symbol for modern, post-industrial life, with all its problems and complexities. It draws a comparison between contemporary life and its pre-Industrial Revolution counterpart, highlighting how much simpler, and at the same time richer, the latter age was.

The first part of the poem makes a reference to the cantonment of Secunderabad, where the British Residency was based and which was developed by the British. It refers to the legacies of the British founders of the city in an almost reverential tone, making a "homage" to them. The mention of "candlelight" is the first in a thread of references to light and sources of light throughout the poem.  
Clock towers, mentioned in the second line, are symbolic of the 18th century and the beginning of "modern life". It was the beginning of science and modern ideas (like democracy). Further, it represents the rise of the *merchant class* – they were the first way for everyone to follow a uniform time and sync up their daily lives. The effect this had on the psychological perception of time was immense – people began to structure their day around clock time, rather than internal mechanisms, before anything else. This is the time period that the poet is evoking by writing his poem by candlelight.

Macaulay, referenced in the next line, represents the English-medium educational institutions that Secunderabad (at the time a part of Hyderabad) was known for. The racist and self-superior ideologies that Macaulay personally stood for and propagated also bring an irony into the poem.  
"Lamplight" is the next in the thread of references to light in the text. Here is where we begin to see the diversity in the *sources* of light brought by era immediately after the Industrial Revolution. This variety emphasises the difference between contemporary times and the era the poem talks – it shows how the human experience has been shaped and affected differently by the different technologies through which our lives are illuminated.

The next few lines take the poem to senses other than sight, through the references to violins and Haydn (known for developing the string quartet). It adds to the technologies of light emission by referring to "gaslight".  
The mention of Haydn is another first in a string of mentions of cultural and political icons of the time that the poem idealises, continued by Isadora, Naoroji, Pitt and Victoria. The mention of Naoroji is significant – it ties into the poet's identity as a Parsi, but also brings to the fore Naoroji's pioneering ideas (like the drain theory) and his political influence (as the first Indian-origin member of the British Parliament). These mentions connect the use of lamplight to the greatness of these personalities and their performances or presentations – Isadora's dance, Pitt's speeches, and so on.

A few lines later mentions the two thousand or so Londoners who choose voluntarily to live in this simpler age, without electricity and modern conveniences (albeit with some lapses). These people are considered saner for their avoidance of modern technologies – this is where the pejoration of the modern era begins in the poem.  
While acknowledging the hardships and disadvantages of the era, he continues to romanticise the age by his references to oak doors, Wedgewood china and Persian rugs. These are all examples of a time when simple objects around the house are all works of art in their own right. The Persian rugs, in particular, emphasise the loss of individuality that mass production brought to such everyday items, and which, incidentally, was made possible by the advent of electricity.

After these lines comes a further complaint about the modern age – coming and going like "today's consciences and friends". This shows a fickleness and loss of morality that the poet sees in the world around him, where everything is disposable and transient.  
"Always the means, never the ends" is another comment in praise of the bygone era, referring to the importance that methods had over aims then. This can be seen as a scathing comment on utilitarian philosophy.

The last line brings to the fore again the utopian previous age, where he says that his ancestors "lived and died without a fuss".
