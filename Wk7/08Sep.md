# Readings (Agha Shahid Ali) (contd.)
## Text (Ghazal)
This ghazal is one of a pair that Agha Shahid Ali wrote on this theme. The fact that he left out a specific title is meant to indicate that it belongs to the ghazal genre, which typically does not assign a title different from the first line of the [मत्ला]{lang=hi}.  
The first version of this ghazal did not have a [क़ाफ़िया]{lang=hi}, and was revised to include one later.

The theme of Arabic relates to a strong sense of a loss of identity, including language and everything it stands for. Arabic itself has a myriad significations – political, scientific, ideological and religious. The use of English as a medium for a traditional genre of poetry prevalent in Urdu and originating in Arabic is a mark of the poet's occupation of different cultural identities simultaneously. In this sense, the ghazal is self-reflexive – it is a look back, through English, to the origins of the genre of ghazals. He calls for a return to the conventional ghazal – ironically, considering the restrictive nature of the genre that would disapprove of his innovation.

At the same time, the ghazal genre questions the most basic assumptions of the western poetic tradition from the time of Aristotle, which emphasises containing unity as a fundamental characteristic. The independence of the various shers of a ghazal flies in the face of this principle.

The first sher makes the connection between Arabic and the sense of loss. It evokes the association Arabic has with homelands and long-forgotten histories. The poet then says that love is as pitiless in Arabic as in any other language. The sher also refers to the tradition of calligraphy, which is going obsolete as print and other forms of writing become popular.  
Words in this sher make clear the connection between this work and the traditional Urdu or Arabic ghazal, typically centred around loss and love.

The next sher creates the image of the miniature paintings that decorated illustrated manuscripts in the pre-print era, and refers to thow the history of this practice is tied to the development of the ghazal. Each brush-stroke in these paintings is an imitation of the lines and curves of the Arabic script.

A reference to a T. S. Eliot's poem, *The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock*, is present in the next sher, where the poet says that the reader (or he himself) may be inspired to one day write a ghazal in Arabic by the perfume of a loved one's dress.

Maimonides, mentioned in the next sher, was a Sephardic Jewish scholar who was an expert on the Torah. Cordoba was a city in the Iberian peninsula during the rule of the Moors, which was a golden age for Jewish culture and scientific advancement. Ali's reference to Maimonides is meant to underline the multilingual and multireligious scholarly tradition that has been undermined by the struggle for the Holy Land. Here, he makes Maimonides a symbol for the shared Judaeo-Arab tradition that is now long gone.

The story of Laila and Majnoon was first narrated in Arabic in the 6th century, by the poet Qais. It was semi-autobiographical – Qais spoke about himself as Majnoon, or "the mad one", in love with a woman named Laila. The story was popularised by the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi, who wrote a retelling of the tale in th 12th century. In this sher, Ali talks about the possibilities of the expression of love that Arabic affords, by saying that pain expressed is "more – not less" in Arabic. The imagery of the caravan is another trope of the ghazal tradition.

Anton Shammas was a Palestinian poet who wrote in Hebrew, Arabic and English. Ali, however, simplifies his identity to the binary opposites of Arabic and Hebrew, which is a stereotype fraught with the struggle between Palestine and Israel.

The next sher refers to Federico Garcia Lorca, a Spanish poet who was openly opposed to the fascist rule in Spain, and assassinated just before the Spanish Civil War. He wrote *qasidas* in Spanish – the *qasida* was an early form of the ghazal that poets wrote in praise of their patrons – based on ones he had read in Andalusi Arabic. Here, Ali refers to how well the *qasida* works out in Spanish, and therefore to his own attempt to superimpose English on the ghazal tradition.

A reference to the Companions of Paradise, mentioned in the Qur'an, is in the next sher. Ali sees this notion through the lens of the western, Orientalist imagination, which perceives the idea in purely sexual terms. He uses this image to point out the long tradition of love poetry that the language of the Qur'an, Arabic, had.

The next sher brings into the picture the detail, the phonetics, of Arabic, in a poem that principally contemplates its history and legacy. The "excess" of sibilant sounds in Arabic, in the eyes of modern notions of aesthetics, is excessive to the point of the Apocalypse. The number of occurrences of the /s/ sound is another self-referential aspect of this.
