# Visual Form
We have seen the shift in narrative style that the events of the 20th century brought about in mainstream literature, towards a more introspective and self-analytic angle. This was paralleled by a shift in the style of poetry, moving towards a greater emphasis on the *visual form* of poems – an example of meta-art.

For example, consider Hoshang Merchant's *Broken Love*. The form of the poem illustrates its theme, in that the sentences are all split over two lines, or "broken", in a sense.

# Readings (Agha Shahid Ali)
## About the Poet
Agha Shahid Ali was a Delhi-born Kashmiri. He grew up speaking Urdu, Kashmiri and English, and received an Irish Catholic education before studying in the US. Central themes of poetry include loss, trauma, hybridity and culture.  
Hybridity refers to the space between two cultures that a person belongs to – Agha Shahid Ali's upbringing was rooted in several cultures, as a Kashmiri Indian brought up in the shadow of the British Raj, and an emigrant to America.

## Text (At the Museum)
The date mentioned at the end of the poem has many interpretations. Many poets do this to mark when and where the poem was written, as a kind of autobiographical signature.

The poem revolves around a figurine of a woman unearthed in the ruins of the Indus Valley civilisation, popularly called "the dancing girl". The poet marvels at the fact that someone thought it worth their while to cast a sculpture of an ordinary, unremarkable woman. He imagines how she must have spent her day, and parallels this to what the sculptor must have had to do to create the figurine.

The phrasing *a child who had to play woman* may be a reference to the gendered role the poet believes this child had to play, as a servant carrying out menial work. It may also be a metaphor for sexual awakening, which is evidenced by the reference to rains in the next line – a common theme in the Indian tradition of [बिरहा]{lang=hi}, or separation, tied to a sexual and romantic desire.

# Mechanics of the Ghazal
The genre of ghazals came from the 7th century Arabic art form called *qasida*. The components integral to a ghazal are:

* [तख़ल्लुस]{lang=hi}, or pen name. For example, *Ghalib*, *Shad*, etc.
* [रदीफ़]{lang=hi}, or the repeating (complete) words at the end of each sher, and at the end of the first line.
* [क़ाफ़िया]{lang=hi}, or the rhyming word occurring just before the [रदीफ़]{lang=hi}.
* [मत्ला]{lang=hi}, or the first sher.
* [मक़्ता]{lang=hi}, or the last sher, with the poet's signature (usually including the [तख़ल्लुस]{lang=hi}).

The purpose of the [रदीफ़]{lang=hi} and [क़ाफ़िया]{lang=hi} is to show the poet's skill in using the same phrase in different contexts. Each sher must make sense individually, but also in the context of the poem.
