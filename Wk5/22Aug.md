# Readings (The Woman in Black)
## About the Author (contd.)
Naiyer Masud's works do not fit into any of the common categories into which Urdu literature is delineated, like classic literature, abstractism, or modernism (to which he comes the closest). He has expressed a dislike for the use of deliberately ambiguous, unclear language, which became common in Indian literary traditions starting in the 1950s.  
Modernism visited South Asia after arising in post-World War Europe, where the societal idealism of the 19th century gave way to an introspective and psychological turn of literature, which was (in some ways) rather abstract in quality.  

Masud, therefore, aims to write in precise, accurate language. However, the message and purpose of his work remains unclear to the reader. His style has been said to focus on he nature of existence, as a philosophical consideration.  
His writing appears to represent the world, but is not realistic in the strictest sense. This is in stark contrast to the undeniable straightforwardness.

## Story
The story was originally named *Nusrat*. The change in title modifies the way we look at the text – one way of looking at it is that it adds a layer of confusion and expectation to the reader's experience.

One possible reading of this story is that it is about loss. Things like the entire trial taking place in a different part of the house, Nusrat being unable to walk, and the permanent closing of the house are evidence for this.

We must also consider the possibility that Masud's stories are not intended to be instructive. They might be meant to be experienced in their full ambiguity and strangeness.

The narrator also appears to be unreliable in some ways. Their claim to not remember the story of the bad woman (p. 29) is in stark contrast to the way their attention is grasped by the trial throughout the first half of the story. Furthermore, they describe several small details of the preparation for the guests' arrival.
