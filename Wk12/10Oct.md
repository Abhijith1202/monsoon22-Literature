# Literature in the Digital Age
Twitterature is a form of literature that invites collaboration, and it has led to a *democratisation* of writing – anyone can write and be widely read. It has changed the way we consume and produce literature.  
The collaborative aspect of internet literature is especially interesting, as it takes us back to a time before print media – the collaborative nature of oral literature.

It has also enabled the incorporation of features of social media (like hashtags and internet language) into narration and language.

The question of genres of twitterature poses some interesting questions: are new genres arising, or are these adaptions of existing genres? Science fiction, mystery, retellings and fan-fiction predominate on Twitter. Retellings are popular as they draw on the popularity of already well-established texts (the canon), they bring to them the brevity and conciseness needed in today's world, and they cast them in a moral setting acceptable in today's society.

Being compressed, as they are, into single tweets, works of twitterature wield intimacy and immediacy to intrigue the reader. Metaphor and irony are powerful tools in this regard.  
Spellings cease to matter, and abbreviations can be used (but frequently are not).

However, the fact that these works are so brief and fleeting leads us to some questions. Is this creative writing of quality, or just another experience in an experience economy? Is it just a commodity that is quickly produced and even more quickly consumed?

The Italian-American scholar Franco Moretti described a notion of "distant reading" – using computers and computational tools to analyse and identify patterns in the huge number of relatively unknown works (what he called *the great unread*). While this method of study uncovers details and information not accessible via close reading, however, it has its limitations.

# Readings (The Last Queen)
## About the Author
Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni is an author, poet and teacher of creative writing, and her works have been widely translated. She specialises in "re-writing" – telling stories from a character who is not the protagonist.

## Historical Fiction
The book is an example of *historical fiction*. It tells the story of Rani Jindan Kaur, the youngest wife of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the king of the Sikh empire.

However, it is not a biography – it is a fictional narrative about real people and events. Fiction relaxes the restriction of realism that history applies on writing, and gives us greater depth into the characters and events. It gives the narrative a perspective of one of the characters, which history does not afford.

## Features of the Book
This book has, apart from the main text, a dedication, an epigraph, a list of major characters, a prologue and an epilogue.

The purpose of a list of characters, like in a play, is so that characters can be brought in without introduction. While they are described briefly during the narrative, it is useful to the reader to know about these characters beforehand.

The book is narrated in first person by Rani Jindan, and is organised in four parts, based on the periods of her life – Girl, Bride, Queen, and Rebel. This indicates that the author is concerned with history, and the narrative is not completelu fictionalised. However, the first two parts are, by necessity, largely speculation.

## Prologue
### Rani Jindan
From the prologue, we get insights into the character of Rani Jindan – she has never cared to cajole gifts from her husband, and she is unfazed by the unfriendly glances of the other wives of the Maharaja.  
We can tell that she has a status different from the other queens, and has a special understanding with the Maharaja.
