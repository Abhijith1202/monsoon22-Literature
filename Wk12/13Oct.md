# Readings (The Last Queen)
## Prologue
### Rani Jindan (contd.)
The people present in the room include the queens, the courtiers, the wazir, and importantly, the heir to the maharaja, Prince Kharak Singh. The author has chosen to describe this scene in the prologue in order to emphasise that this is a pivotal moment in the story and in Jindan's life.

### Narration
The use of a third-person narrator during the prologue makes it a kind of introduction to Jindan's character. 

The prologue also gives us a summary of the important aspects of her life – her rags-to-riches story in a nutshell. It tells us what she learnt from her childhood and how it helped her to negotiate court politics.

### Characterisation
Another main character is introduced in the prologue – Wazir Dhian Singh Dogra, the prime minister of the maharaja. His character and importance in the court are quickly and effectively described. His face is "chiselled from granite" (this is an example of an undercurrent of metaphors based on material throughout the text), which gives the impression of toughness, harshness and inscrutability. His loyalty and affection for the maharaja are also highlighted here.

Minor characters, like Kharak Singh, the crown prince, are also described here.

### Narrative Tension
The prologue encapsulates the major themes in the story, describing the atmosphere of tension in the room – the army is being kept ready, and Jindan is worried about her and her son's future. Her grief for her husband is also apparent.

## Part I: Girl
We know that in the beginning of this part, Jindan is nine years old. Her family is poor, judging by their possessions and the fact that her brother goes out to steal food for them.

This section provides us, as readers, individualising aspects of Jindan that sketch a future queen. Her impatience, strength, and ambition are seeded in her character from the very beginning.

It is clear that she loves her brother and has a strong sense of loyalty towards him. She has no particular relationship with her absent father, Manna Singh, who is constructed as a character who cannot be trusted.

Furthermore, her endearing aspects and humour are apparent in the narration of the events in this section.

### Historical Fiction
Material detail is given great attention throughout the book, due to its function in historically situating the novel. This is an important feature of historical fiction.  
Another aspect of historical fiction that is illustrated here is the capacity of writers to give events literary qualities like irony or prophecy – like the maharaja's comment about "being stuck on a stinking sickbed".  
Historical fiction also adds colour, dimension and life to the dull factuality of historical narration.

### Lahore
Lahore, in the first part of the text, is associated with Manna and only seen through Biji's eyes. To her, it has brought only frustration, fear and anxiety. She sees through Manna's offer to take Jindan to Lahore and identifies his real intentions – to profit materially from the prettiness of his daughter.

The reality of Manna's life in Lahore is a shock – she is locked up alone in his dirty, dilapidated hut, while Jawahar begins to enjoy his work at the forge.

To Jindan herself, Lahore has a mythical quality. She has an image of Lahore in her mind that is associated with mystery, myth and intrigue, and she is unwilling to write it off even after Manna's lies.
