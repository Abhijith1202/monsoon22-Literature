# Pre-Class
## Like the Sun
* **Language.** Simple and brief. Very little descriptions/embellishments.
* **Setting.** Over two days in the life of Sekhar. From his POV.
* **Structure.**
    * Begins with Sekhar's thoughts on truth. Continuously switches between narrator's and Sekhar's thoughts ("I suppose ... dazed."; "Otherwise ... living."). Starts on an optimistic note.
        - Why secret?
        - What is the significance of "eternity"?
    * Trials: wife, colleague, headmaster
        - Wife
            - Usually shields her feelings, but blunt today.
            - Was still able to maintain resolve despite seeing her wince.
            - Another example of Sekhar's thoughts without quotations ("Truth ... sun.").
        - Colleague
            - Frank to the point of rudeness. Cuts short colleague as well.
            - Getting carried away with truth? Forgets basic manners.
            - Lil judgmental it seems (also later, "He croaks ... in a storm.")
        - Headmaster
            - Scared of HM? Sudden politeness; hesitation (ellipses); "timidly"; pretends not to hear question
                - Maybe that's why he buttoned up his coat, but convinced himself it was because of sermonising
                - Won't admit to himself? Proud? (also the bluntness, judgment)
            - HM is friendly from the beginning; confers favours at home.
            - Takes very seriously: hired musicians, full-dress, called critic, Rangoon mat
                - Self-importance: "like a professional at a concert"
            - Sekhar hesitates for the first time ("pretended .. question").                - A whole bunch of emotions: "pity", "pained", "helpless", "unhappy"
                    - Why only HM, not wife or dead colleague?
                - Begins to realise strength inherent in being truthful also.
        - Most worried by HM. Not worried about personal life?
            - Straw that broke the camel's back?
        - HM pretends to be happy with the truth; thanks and all.
            - Reconsiders test papers lmaoooo. He had it coming.
    * At the end of everything, calls it a "luxury". He doesn't regret it?
        - Is this idealism?
        - Feels it's worth it to sit up all night with papers?
        - Convinced himself he's like Harishchandra?
            - Lost everything on the strength of a promise
            - Suffered at the hands of Vishwamitra
            - But ended up in heaven. Maybe that's why?

## Chippy
* **Language.** Similar.
* **Setting.** Over a few years; India.
* **Structure.**
    * Coming into Swami's possession.
        - Pekingese incident: kind of a bully ("when no one was about"; "forced the puny fellow")
    * Life with Swami.
        - Spent a lot of time together: devoted
        - Irony here: Chippy's self-importance ("decent dog") compared to biting, tearing, etc., and "knock down ... short dogs". Elitist thodasa.
    * The newcomer.
        - Prejudice against short dogs? Random violence.
        - Not affected by the kick from Swami: no ill feeling, "went bounding" later
        - Obedient: wagged tail and nodded and all.
        - Chippy's prejudice extends to not spending time with Swami.
    * Departure
        - Soon hungered for Swami's company.

# Characters
[Abrams, p. 32-4, p. ?]
[Barnet et al., p. 101-2]

## Study of Characters
Showing and telling are two strategies that author use to reveal character. Showing ("the dramatic method") means that the character *does* something to reveal their emotion, rather than explicitly stating it, or telling it to the reader.

The study of a character is based on three main questions:

* what is a character driven by?
* how do they develop?
* how do they interact with other characters?

Consider the example of Lentina. Lentina may be considered a round character, showing a lot of nuance and complexity in character, not fitting into the social moulds of a wife, mother or mother-in-law. While her single-minded obsession with the laburnum tree may be considered a mark of "flatness", it still serves as a means of revealing things about her character.  
In a study of Lentina's character, we can ask a number of questions: Whom are we expected to sympathise with, her or her family? How do we know? What do we know about other characters and her relationships with them?

## Narratorial Persona
Narrators may be of different types. A third-person narrator, for instance, simply narrates the story from outside, giving no acknowledgement of the reader's existence. On the other hand, a narrator may interact with the reader, and have some narratorial signposting, that gives them a persona as well.

# Themes
A theme is an abstract idea or concept underlying a piece of writing. For example, *Laburnum for My Head* might be considered to have a theme of death â€“ a recurring notion in the story.

A recurring symbol, or object, in a literary work is a *motif*. The main motif in any work of art is called the *leitmotif*, which in the case of this story is the laburnum and Lentina's obsession with it.

Another kind of recurring element is a *trope*, an example of which is the overtone and undertone of *strangeness* in this story. Lentina's state of mind and the development of her character is told through her love for the laburnum.  
Elements of strangeness have a long history in literature, including Indian folk and the Gothic movement that started in 18th-century Europe. The latter tradition might be an influence behind Ao's use of this trope.

# Characteristics of a Short Story
Short stories, like novels, have *protagonists* and *plots*, and are narrated from one or more *points of view*.  
[Abrams p. 286]

## Classification
Short stories may be stories of incident, or stories of character. The former rely on the "course and outcome of events", while the latter depend on the psychology of the protagonist.

*Like the Sun* has what is called a *fabular* quality, of which the essence is *repetition* of a certain motif (in this case, Sekhar speaking the truth).

## Narrative Strategies
The narrative strategies of the short story are distinct from those of the novel. Some of the points of difference are:

* a limited number of characters, restricted by space constraints
* a less dense or detailed social milieu
* minimal setting

"...the genre of the novel tends towards inclusion, that of the short story towards exclusion..." (Barth, p. 26)
