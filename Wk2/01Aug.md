# Literary Analysis or Criticism
Literary analysis or literary criticism is the interpretation of a literary text, arriving at an understanding of the text, and contributing to making meaning about the text. It is important to look at all facets of a text and compare them, to understand what could be considered the "strongest" position on the text.

When a reader interprets and analyses a text, they participate in its creation – this is a pillar of reader response criticism theory, a recent development in the field of literary study. An author gives only partial meaning to a text; the reader "fills in the gaps".

## Mechanics of Literary Analysis
Interpreting and analysing a literary text involves making arguments or claims about it, and justifying them using supporting evidence from the text. One explains one's evidence using reasoning, logic, argumentation, and justification.

The mechanics of analysis rely mainly on asking three questions:

* What is being said?
* How is it being said?
* Why is it being said?

The technique of reading attentively and purposefully, and thoroughly considering all its elements and aspects, is called *close-reading*.

Practically speaking, we will consider language, setting, structure, characters, narratorial persona, plot, and social and political analysis in a reading of a text.

# Laburnum for My Head
## Language
* "magnificent incongruity": This phrase highlights the contrast between the laburnum tree's extravagance and the gloominess of the concrete headstones.
* "annual show of yellow splendour": The use of "yellow" with "splendour" lends concreteness to an abstract concept.
* "shy showing": The flowers are anthropomorphised here, their blooming compared to the shyness of a person.

## Setting
The protagonist belongs to a well-to-do family, with some stature in society.

The time frame of the story is approximately five to six years, from the death of Lentina's husband to her own. The historical time period (from the references to cars and DDT) is the late 20th century.

Spatially, the events in the story occur at various levels – the town, the house, and Lentina's bedroom. We have very little clue as to the exact location of the story.

## Structure
How is the text constructed? Certain paragraphs address the reader directly (narratorial signposting), while some stick to the story itself.  

This story has some instances of narratorial signposting, *e.g.*,

* "but the story ... from the beginning." (page 12)
* "so ends the story of ... a year on her crown." (page 20)

Another aspect of text structure is how much of the text consists of direct speech (spoken by characters), and how much is reported or descriptive (narration). This can be a big part of the meaning.

## Characters
A character is simply a figure in a literary work. They are usually distinguished into flat, or stock (one-dimensional, simple) and round (complex, more believable) characters.

One reason why flat characters are important is to keep the focus on the main (usually round) character. However, another important justification lies in the genre of the work – a short story – which by nature does not have enough space to devote to fuller descriptions of less important characterless important characters.
