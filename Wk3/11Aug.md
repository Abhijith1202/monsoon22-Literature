# Readings (Chippy)
## Point of View (contd.)

## Character
Some immediate notes about Chippy's character are:

* attention-seeking: his resentment towards other dogs in the same house
* judgmental, sense of superiority: "decent dog"
* aggression: his first instinct in most situations is violence; "had to shed ... in those lanes"

Another part of Chippy's nature is how much he considers his place in the world to revolve around his master, his house and his territory. Being deprived of any of these to the smallest extent takes away his allegiance to it – he runs away from home at the slightest hint of losing his place of refuge to another dog.

## Humour
The author uses many devices to express humour in the story. For example, "...he only wanted to give him a good shake..." uses understatement juxtaposed with the supposed sincerity of Chippy's actions to provide comedic value.  
The fact that Chippy was "...almost a member of the Champion Tennis Club" and "...never missed a single meeting" is humorous due to the anthropomorphisation of Chippy. Other examples of this are the "businesslike manner" in which the newcomer walks past Chippy at his spot behind the garage.  
The ending, too, is an example of *dark humour* – in this case humour through irony.

## Social Reality and the Short Story
All art is rooted in a particular social and political context; it cannot exist in a vacuum. Even if the artist is not openly political or does not address social issues in writing. For example, the number of dystopian science fiction stories arising out of the Soviet era.

## About the Author
Gogu Shyamala was born into a poor agricultural family in Rangareddy district (modern Telangana) – her mother was an agricultural labourer, her father a daily-wage labourer, and her brother a bonded labour. She was sent to school because she was too weak to work in the fields; after class XII, she went into politics and later copmleted a law degree.

Her stories embody Dalit language, social culture and history. They describe the "world of the little, subaltern traditions, as against that of the great traditions". They have a memorialising function in the Dalit culture – they record Dalit lives and traditions without nostalgia.
