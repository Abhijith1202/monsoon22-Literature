## About the Author
RK Narayan was a major writer of early Indian English literature, known for his works like *Swami and Friends* and *Malgudi Days*. His writing is marked by humour and the rendering into words of human nature; his works offer a good study in the traditional short story genre.

He is remembered for writing about middle-class life and characters. His stories have a *detached* narrator, who does not opine or analyse, but only reports.

## Characteristics of the Short Story
The short story has four major characteristics – compression, implicativeness, rendition and precise observation.  

*Compression* involves condensing a long duration of time or experience – the exact duration may vary depending on the time frame of the story itself. For example, James Joyce's *Ulysses* takes place across a single day; a "long" period in that case may extend to an hour or two.  
*Chippy* opens with a paragraph that compresses the protagonist Chippy's childhood, until the time he moves in with Swami.

*Implicativeness* is the avoidance of repetition by implied context, which has been previously provided. A short story, unlike a novel, does not have the space to expand on matters that have already been described. For example, the concluding sentence of *Chippy* does not go into the thoughts and reactions of Chippy, but we as readers are well aware of the roller coaster the master's information must have taken him on.

*Rendition* is held in contrast to *assertion* – it is showing, as opposed to telling. For example, Chippy's attitude about stray dogs is revealed in the sentence "Why should these street dogs question a decent dog's movements?" – his sense of superiority is shown here, rather than explicitly told.  
Another illustration of rendition is the end of *Like the Sun*, where the headmaster withdraws the deadline extension he had given Sekhar for the papers he had to correct, showing that the headmaster is hiding his annoyance by punishing Sekhar for his bluntness. Further, the *mehmaan-navazi* of the headmaster towards Sekhar at the beginning of his visit – although open to interpretation – may be considered a mark of how shallow he considered Sekhar (it may also be a sincere gesture, however).  
A third example from *Like the Sun* is the headmaster's wife's appearance in the story, sandwiched between sentences that express the poor quality of the headmaster's singing – possibly indicating she was waiting for someone to be honest enough with her husband for him to stop trying to learn music.

*Precise observation* is the last characteristic of a short story. The treatment Sekhar receives at the headmaster's house is described very briefly – "At home the headmaster ... son-in-law of the house". The usage of the analogy to the *son-in-law* is a very dense cultural metaphor; the son-in-law is the person with whom the daughter is going to live when she leaves the house, and is consequently regularly treated like a king by his in-laws.

However, note that these are not the only literary qualities of the short story – qualities change over time as different influences and events change literature.

## Barth's Postmodern Experiments with the Short Story
Barth experimented with the briefness of the short story and the "nestedness" of the frame narrative. He wrote a one-sentence short story and analysed the depth of frame tales, finding that they rarely exceeded five levels of nesting.

## Point of View
[Abrams p. 231]

The point of view is "the way a story gets told"; it is the voice that narrates the story to the reader.

**Recommended.** *Chimera* (John Barth), *My Name is Red* (Orhan Pamuk).

Over the past two centuries, the narrator has gained in importance in literature (mainly in the Western tradition). Writers may use many points of view in a single work, with different combinations of first-, third- and second-person voice. This emphasis on the narrator did not extend to the ancient Indian literary tradition, which was primarily oral in nature – the oral nature of the consumption of the work meant that the narrator had to have a complex, attractive personality in order to be heard.

Modern narrators may even be unreliable in some ways – this makes the narrator another dimension in the story, adding complexity and avenues of development for the plot. Messing with the narrator can evoke very strong feelings in the reader. The events of the 19th century shook the western world's perception of itself and of civilisation, bringing introspection and changing perspectives into the picture.

### Third-Person Narration
The third-person narrator is a person outside the story who refers to all the characters in the story by name (note that, in more recent literature, the narrator may have a story of their own). An example of the third-person narrator – in this case, one who does not enter the minds of the characters – is Gustave Flaubert's *Madame Bovary*. The extent to which the narrator can describe the mental states of the narrator lies on a spectrum of *degrees of omniscience*. For example, a narrator with limited omniscience has access to the thoughts of one character (or a few characters), called the *focus* of the story.

A narrator may also be intrusive or unintrusive – they may or may not comment on or evaluate the actions and thoughts of the characters, or express personal opinions about the story.

### First-Person Narration
A first-person narrator is a *participant* in the story. The narrative here is limited by the experiences, knowledge and inferences of the narrator.

**Recommended.** *In the Woods* (Tana French).

### Second-Person Narration
The story is narrated by a narrator, addressing another person as *you*. The addressee here could be the reader or a character in the story. An example of this is *If on a Winter's Night a Traveller*, by Italo Calvino. This work is also a *self-reflexive* or *involuted* novel, which includes in its own narration reference to the process of composing the story itself. Calvino involves the reader in the imagination and creation of his novel by addressing and including them in the story.
