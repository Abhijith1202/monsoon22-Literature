# Readings (Silence! The Court is in Session) (contd.)
The point where Miss Benare enters the witness-box marks a shift from fiction to unambiguous reality. Sukhatme here addresses her as "Prisoner Miss Benare", rather than "the accused". She is trapped and powerless – although she refuses to cooperate, the others pretend as if she has done what they expect of her, and move on. For example, she is assumed to have taken the oath, revealed her age, and so on.

Related to this is Sukhatme's insistence that her name is Leela Damle, not Benare – this carries with it the implication that her identity is now irretrievably linked to Professor Damle. We also note the discussion on her age, in which Mrs. Kashikar is certain that it can be guessed and puts it at just over thirty-two. These, and other such events, show how Miss Benare's narrative of her own life and morals is spinning out of control and being defined by the others' idea.  
Mrs. Kashikar's comment also shames Miss Benare for her age (more specifically, for being single at her age). Sukhatme's questions following this comment (where he describes her age as "mature", and then "advanced") reinforce this. This simply adds to her sense of humiliation and helplessness on the stand.

The dichotomy between speech and silence is important from this point. In oratory and political or ethical discourse, the metaphor of *voice* for agency is well established – for example, "the voice of the people". The "silencing" of oppressed communities parallels this.  
This play, however, goes against this metaphor, through Miss Benare's use of silence as a show of agency and a means of resistance. She is aware that anything she says will be twisted against her, and so makes her unwillingness to cooperate known through her silence.

Mrs. Kashikar is a significant character, in that she has become an instrument of the patriarchy. She vociferously rages against Miss Benare's "freedom" – how many men she roams around with, and how she sings, dances, and cracks jokes. One aspect of this is Mrs. Kashikar's resentment and envy of the freedom that Miss Benare has enjoyed, without the compromise of being attached to a man; however, this is more than a clash between two individuals. Mrs. Kashikar here is voicing society's expectation from women to be self-effacing and subdued, which is emphasised in her objections to Miss Benare's behaviour. The force with which she delivers this diatribe is highlighted by her placing her knitting in Sukhatme's hands.

Miss Benare finally speaks up after Rokde's testimony (later overturned by Karnik). She is, however, completely ignored – the others have decided what to think of her and are determined to reinforce this conclusion. Sukhatme's authoritative summing up of Rokde's false evidence lends it weight in the "court".  
She again registers her protest when Ponkshe is about to reproduce the whole conversation he had with her, and he proceeds to make her a scapegoat while revealing general gossip.

Sukhatme plays the counsel for the defence too, but only as a facade. All witnesses are absent, including Professor Damle, and Kashikar refuses the request to cross-examine the witness of the prosecution. The closing address he gives is halfhearted and pointless. Miss Benare tries to consume the poison she keeps in her purse, but her efforts are foiled.

The end of the trial is followed by Miss Benare's monologue, which happens while all the characters are frozen and the stage is dark. She talks about how suicide made her feel that life is worth living, and highlights the irony that "life is not worthy of life". However, as the lights come on and the characters unfreeze, her time is over and she is sentenced by Kashikar.

The end of the play is marked by the village audience entering the hall asking for the performance. The troupe members leave Miss Benare motionless, alone with a bottle of poison.

# Literature in the Digital Age
There is an interest in retelling classics in a form that makes use of digital media. Social media is more than a network – it became a public diary. Established authors use it to interact with their following; it has also taken literary culture online through reading communities and such. It has also brought self-publishing to the scene.
