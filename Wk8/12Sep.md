# Readings (Agha Shahid Ali)
## Text (Ghazal) (contd.)
The second-last sher is an example of the predominant use of the first person in a ghazal. It refers to Yehuda Amichai, an Israeli poet who wrote (in Arabic) predominantly on "universal" themes such as death. Ali establishes that such universals are shared even by "enemies", like Jews and Arabs (represented by Hebrew and Arabic).

The last sher of the ghazal is the [मक़्ता]{lang=hi}, since it contains the [तख़ल्लुस]{lang=hi}. The literal reading of this sher is that the poet's first name means different things in different languages, but it has a number of metaphorical readings as well.  
The capitalisation of "The Beloved" in the second line suggests that it is referring to a certain, specific lover, which might be Laila or Majnoon (as the legend of Majnoon and Laila was first popularised in Farsi). The connection to the previous sher (established by the word "witness") indicates that he has seen a loved one die – which is a reference to the sense of loss associated with the linguistic identity of a hybrid condition.

"The Beloved" may also simply be a reference to the long tradition of the ghazal in Farsi love poetry, or a to God or Prophet Muhammad.

# Refrain and Return
A refrain is a repeating line or set of words that occur repeatedly. The [रदीफ़]{lang=hi} is an example of a refrain in the ghazal tradition.

The *hybrid postcolonial subject*, especially the immigrant, is constantly assailed by the idea of *return* – going back to the place they once knew. This is not the kind of return that can be achieved by moving or relocation; it is a yearning for a place that no longer exists, an imagined homeland.

The refrain in Agha Shahid Ali's ghazal, *in Arabic*, is an expression of return – it expresses a desire for a lost culture, identity, and homeland.

The fact that the place to which the subject wishes to return no longer exists means that the return is only possible in language and in memory, and is therefore a common theme in poetry.

# The Haiku
A haiku is a form of poetry that originated in Japan, consisting of three lines, with five, seven, and five syllables respectively. It was described by Basho, one of its great practitioners, as "what is happening in this place, at this moment".

The literal meaning of the word *haiku* is "pleasure verse" – it is not an attempt to answer or probe deep philosophical thoughts, but written in a light spirit. It was originally the opening part of a longer poem called *renga*.

There are more formal constraints on the haiku. One of these is the *kireji*, or "cutting word", which is usually not translated but represented with a dash or a comma. A haiku must also have a clear mention of the season or the time of day.

A *senryu* is a humorous or satirical haiku.

The haiku tends to contain a lot of concrete images, and is not meant for philosophical, religious or political reflections or representation. It is rooted in a certain, specific experience, at a single time and place. Its central notion is a profound attention to minute things.

Since the haiku is based around the perception and experience of a single moment, it can be deeply personal and has also been used for self-portraiture. It encourages us to slow down and notice contrasts, paradoxes and irony in small, everyday things. It elevates them to poetry without the use of elaborate language. In a sense, the haiku is about "the 'spiderness' of the spider ... not the author's esteemed ability to write about spiders" (Jenkins xxiv).

Early masters of the haiku, like Basho, wrote in and about a pre-industrial world. The haiku was championed by an emerging merchant class in Japan – this class was initially looked down upon by "high" society (the class that earned their wealth by inheritance) as they were thought to be out for their self-interest alone (since they had to earn their fortunes). The merchants therefore disdained tradition and fixed their priorities on the present. The haiku represented, as an aspect of this disdain, a rebellion against court poetry.  

For example, consider the following haiku, from *Time's Barter* by Kynpham Sing Nongkynrih:

*pears, plums, back cherries:*  
*for how long, when iron rods*  
*are pointing at the sky?*

One (literal) reading would be as a description of the fruits hanging on a tree, and of a rod that was approaching to pluck them or knock them off the branches.  
The "iron rods" may also refer to buildings and such artificial constructions (modernity in general), whose creation involves the destruction of nature. The poet speculates how long nature will remain untouched, while more and more buildings are made, for which trees are continually being cut down.

The *kireji* here is represented by a colon.

# Readings (Time's Barter)
## About the Poet
Kynpham Sing Nongkynrih is a poet, writer and translator from Cherrapunji, Meghalaya. He belongs to the Khasi tribe and has written poetry in Khasi as well as English (specifically Haikus); his work has been translated into Hindi and Bengali. He has received a number of awards for his work.

His haikus often do not conform to the usual 5-7-5 rhythm (see the example above), especially in the middle line. He writes about the natural beauty of the hills, but also about the effect of time and development.

## Text
*nine days of rain:*  
*what use the crowing*  
*of a cockerel?*

The literal reading for this is the effect created by continuous rain, of days and nights blurred into one, a situation where there is no point waiting for sunrise (marked by the crowing of a cockerel).
