# Readings (Time's Barter)
## Text (contd.)
*creepy caterpillar,*  
*when did you become*  
*these flying colours?*

This is highlighting the process of transformation from the caterpillar to the colourful butterfly. The poet is marvelling at the fact that they did not witness this process.

*wife's promotion and transfer –*  
*life's*  
*bitter-sweet-bitter things...*

The use of the word "bitter-sweet-bitter" is significant here. It could be referring to the wife's happiness, the poet's own loneliness at her transfer, or his envy at her success, or all three.

*midsummer night –*  
*the moon, a snake boat*  
*fishing stars.*

The point that haikus are meant to give us a sense of time, either passing or standing still, is important in this one. It draws a parallel between a river and the night sky – the moon is a boat, and it is fishing stars out. As it is midsummer, the night is short and the stars are disappearing one by one.  
The use of the word "snake" may not literally refer to a snake boat; it may be a description of the moon "snaking" through the water.

*autumn sky spreading*  
*heaps of cotton wool – all set*  
*to make winter rugs.*

"Cotton wool" here may refer to clouds or snow, which have the appearance of rugs. This haiku is about the transition from autumn to winter.  
Another point in favour of this is that the cotton harvest season starts just before winter.

*fresh green leaves*  
*an orange tree – white atop*  
*my head, also fresh.*

The author here is referring to his advanced age; the "white atop [his] head" is his greying hair. He says that this white is fresh, like the leaves on the orange tree; however, he is getting older while the tree remains young. The use of "fresh" may indicate that he remains young at heart despite being physically old.  
It could also refer to the flowers of the orange tree that have fallen on his head.

*self-authored volume*  
*newly arrived – I begin by*  
*smelling the stories.*

This haiku captures the moment an author receives a published copy of his own work. By saying that he is "smelling the stories", he describes how he is savouring and relishing the moment.  
The "newly arrived" may indicate that he feels that he is recently successful and has "made it".

*winding road by a river –*  
*jingling church bells?*  
*a smithy.*

We have a description of a sound, and an element of confusion brought in by the question mark. The author may have been rounding a turn in a road, expecting a church, but come across a smithy instead.

# Drama
The term "drama" originated with Aristotle's classification of literary genres, which had three classes – epic, poetry, and drama (which parallels Kalidasa's classification from 800 years later).

## About the Playwright
Vijay Tendulkar was originally a journalist, and began to write (starting with one-act plays) in the 1950s as part of the progressive theatre movement.  
The progressive movement in writing aimed to represent realities in literature, rather than idealistic or utopian scenarios. Its continuation into theatre was based on the notion that in a largely pre-literate country, acting and drama were the best way to send out a message to the masses.

Tendulkar's works include revolutionary and radical themes related to social justice, including love, sex and other such "taboo" topics, in terms of unromantic, gritty realities. He exposed the hypocrisy and injustice of middle-class morals, and depicted violence and aggression as a part of human life.

The characters in Tendulkar's work are both typified as well as individualised, generally middle-class men and women.

He has received several awards for his work, and the current work (originally [शांतता! कोर्ट चालू आहे]{lang=hi}, 1967) set him apart from other Marathi playwrights. This play captures a situation that is shocking even by today's standards.

It is to be remembered that all plays are meant to be performed, which makes for a number of formal characteristics of plays when in text form. For example, we have a list of characters, stage directions, and no narrator.
