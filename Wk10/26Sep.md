# Readings (Silence! The Court is in Session) (contd.)
The setting of this play is a village hall, where an amateur troupe, the Sonar Moti Tenement (Bombay) Progressive Association, are practising and performing a mock lawcourt carrying out a trial against President Johnson and atomic weapons. It is set (and written) in the 1960s. The "play within the play" brings an element of self-referentiality into the work. Throughout the work, Tendulkar throws in subtle satire towards the world of theatre, including himself and those he has worked with.

Of special significance are the songs and rhymes Miss Benare sings from time to time.

The play opens with Miss Benare and Samant talking to each other. This scene gives us time to get to know Miss Benare, from her views and opinions. She is seen to have a lot of clarity and insight, and seems to know more about life than most.  
Her comment about children and how they are "so much better than adults" contains some hints towards her character. Her statement that "they don't scratch ... like cowards" shows that she is especially hurt by some people talking about her behind her back. Talking about this also gets her very flustered and uncomfortable, and she asks for the window to be opened.  
She also makes a radical point in her remark about education's disconnect from intelligence. This is especially significant in light of her being a teacher – she obviously does not have delusions about the importance of her profession. As a person, this tells us that she can see clearly through things without being fooled by facades. This aspect of her character makes her and Professor Damle *foils* to each other (characters that highlight each other).

There are lots of such details in the first Act that show how critical she is of society and hypocrisy. Her comments on Kashikar ("Mr. Prime Objective" – satirising his tendency to use bureaucratic language in pretensions to being a public man, and his pedantry), Sukhatme ("swatting flies with legal precedents" – criticising his self-importance as a lawyer), and Professor Damle ("when there's a real-life problem, away he runs!" – mocking his disconnect from the real world and reliance on theoretical knowledge).

The indirect medium of poetry and songs, mostly sung by Miss Benare, is put to use to talk about things that are taboo. This is an example of what is called *polyphony* ("different voices") – the text puts in words many different points of view, although it may not be clear which is emphasised.  
For example, her rhyme starting "Oh, I've got a sweetheart..." is one such secret hidden in plain sight. Another rhyme she mentions is "The grass is green ... till I am dead!", which she wrote in the inside of all her notebooks. Immediately after this, she emphasises that she is "not dead", three times – this indicates some kind of defiance or surprise, that she has survived something.  
Her remonstration of Samant (when he says he wants to write her rhyme down) expresses a deep criticism of the shallowness with which people respond to most things they hear or see. Samant's response, however, shows that he has understood nothing from her rant.  
Her individuality and self-reliance is another aspect of her character, demonstrated in her dismissal of Tukaram's quote. This is also another veiled criticism of people who mindlessly quote popular figures without any understanding of the words.  
Her rant later about the enquiry she is facing makes many of these aspects of her character even clearer. She is aware of the rumours about her (she directly refers to them), and acknowledges their truth, but does not feel she has done anything wrong. Furthermore, the sheer length of the rant shows how much it is occupying her mind and serves to show a different side of her from the vivacious, opinionated persona she has been showing. The stage directions give more clues at this point as well.

All characters also have their own pretensions and, in different ways, represent society and the state. For example, Kashikar has delusions of being a great public personality, and Rokde of being an important and famous actor.

Professor Damle, although he does not appear, is referred to a lot. As soon as his name is mentioned, Miss Benare gets flustered and goes silent, and the other characters make comments about him. Ponkshe (possibly inadvertently) heightens the tension by referring to Miss Benare's "friend in trouble".

The characters' decision to carry out a mock trial against Miss Benare is another incident that shows their personalities – Sukhatme's pompousness, the characters' social pretensions, and so on.
