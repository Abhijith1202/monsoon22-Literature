# Readings (Silence! The Court is in Session) (contd.)
All the tension in the room is expressed in an unspoken understanding, or euphemistic code, among the characters. It is never stated outright for the audience or readers, thus building *narrative tension*, or suspense, and creating a hint of intrigue that keeps the audience engaged.

Miss Benare's reaction to the fictional charge against her that was decided in her absence is telling – she freezes and looks around, stunned. When asked why she was being so serious, however, she passes off this reaction as part of her art. This is the beginning of a thread of blending reality and fiction throughout the play – the lawyer's part that Sukhatme plays, and the mock seriousness of Ponkshe and Kashikar despite the informal atmosphere, are other occurrences in this thread. They use court vocabulary and patterns of speech, all the while spitting out paan or making jokes – they take away the substance of a trial, while maintaining its formality and language. In effect, they make it a *farce*.  
The behaviour of the troupe shows that they are trying to show off their acting prowess or knowledge of court proceedings.

The pretend-trial, however, is a very real ordeal for Miss Benare, as its premise is a facade for suspicions about her real life. This is another aspect of the merging of reality and fiction.

Mrs. Kashikar's dialogue is a demarcation of the two worlds, in a way that creates humour and demonstrates her role in the troupe. She patronises Samant, explaining to him which parts of the mock trial are representative of actual court proceedings and which are not.  
Karnik, on the other hand, is unclear about the local context – during an interchange with Sukhatme, he is confused about whether it is with regard to the mock trial, or to real life. This interchange also highlights Sukhatme's personal vendetta against Miss Benare, the only person who sees through his grandiose gestures and knows him for what he is – a failed lawyer. Sukhatme tries to push this pretend trial towards a real social punishment for Miss Benare.

The constant reinforcement of the fictionality of the rehearsal has the opposite effect – it convinces the audience that the trial is an excuse for the troupe members to express their otherwise unspeakable suspicions towards Miss Benare. This is the purpose for the continual oscillation between reality and fiction, and for the specific choice of infanticide for the "mock" charge against Miss Benare.  
More specifically, it gives an opportunity to the members of the troupe – who are "types", representative of society and its norms – to take Miss Benare to trial. Throughout, they protect themselves from any backlash by pretending that it is "just a game".

At this point, Samant throws himself into character in the witness stand – he outlines an entire imaginary scenario that he claims took place at Professor Damle's house, pretending to be reading out of a book (which is in fact the Oxford English Dictionary). Miss Benare reacts to this by getting defensive, which gives the members of the court more motivation.  
Samant's narrative is formed around common societal perceptions of single women and their friendships with men and their romantic and sexual relationships, and around the social tendency to blame the woman for any impropriety. At this point, furthermore, Professor Damle is nowhere to be seen and the troupe memebrs are not troubled by his thoughts. The readiness of the characters to believe this is a reflection of society's hunger for scandals and shameful secrets.

Miss Benare's response is to be flippant and frivolous about the entire proceeding – she laughs and jokes throughout the entire business. She and Kashikar further blur the distinction between fiction and reality by their exchange following this.  
Sukhatme refers to the seriousness of the charge, which brings on a string of defiant responses by Miss Benare – she uses this opportunity to challenge the supposed right of men to define moral boundaries on a woman's life. For example, she asks Sukhatme how he knows that motherhood is a sacred thing, and how Ponkshe would know what the "normal" conduct of an unmarried woman should be.

Karnik's responses in general show him in a more open-minded light than most others. He gives simple answers to Sukhatme's moral questions, without being influenced by social constructs built around them – he refuses to reinforce Sukhatme's expected responses or reiterate the cultural significance of ideas like motherhood. Rather, he focuses on the literal, denotative, biological meanings.

Here Miss Benare decides that there is no harm in revealing she was at Damle's house. She confirms Samant's story but refuses to admit to doing anything wrong. This is the point at which the fog clears and fiction becomes reality. Miss Benare is forcibly put into the witness box, and she is terrified. Sukhatme begins to play the role of a lawyer more and more earnestly, throwing out directions and making the trial more realistic.
