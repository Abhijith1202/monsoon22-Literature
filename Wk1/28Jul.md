# Introduction
## Why Do We Read?
Literature (in this course) is simply creative writing. We may read as a form of escapism, to be inspired creatively, or to learn from and understand another's perspective.

## Genres of Literature
Genres are classes, or types, of literature, *e.g.*, novels (or short stories or novellas), poetry, or drama. However, these are not clear-cut domains; there are items of literature which belong to the liminal space between genres, like letters and autobiographies.  
According to the Aristotelian definition of genres, "works are classified in accordance with the similarity in the principles by which they are organised in order to achieve a partiuclar kind of emotional effect".

While genres form a useful categorisation of literary works, it must be kept in mind that they are not absolute and not unambiguous.

# "Literariness"
In what way are non-literary texts (newspaper articles, advertisements, or reports) different from literary texts? An important difference is *craft language* – as important as *what* is being said, is *how* it is being said. The degree to which imagination plays a role in the creation of the work, and the elements of storytelling present in it, are also important distinctions.  
Genres that illustrate this are magic realism (authors: Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Isabela Allende, Salman Rushdie [Midnight's Children], Gita Hariharan [When Dreams Travel]) and postmodern fiction.

An important distinction (but not an unequivocal one) is that academic writing (as opposed to literature) strives towards neutrality, while literature is subjective. This is not to say that fact-checking is not applicable to literature, or that academic writing is not creative, but rather that literature is distinguished by its *imaginative* character.
