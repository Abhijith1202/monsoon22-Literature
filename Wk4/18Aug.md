# Readings (But Why Shouldn't the Baindla Woman Ask for Her Land?)
## Story
The main event in the story is the first conversation Saayamma has with the village elders. During this conversation, she is requested to perform the rites for the Ooradamma jatra, and she agrees on the condition that she be allowed to cultivate the land she owns. This comes after the elders explicitly allow her to raise any issue she would like as payment for her services; despite this, they dismiss her concerns and accuse her of "talking loosely".  
This conversation represents the common perception of the working class by the middle or upper class, *e.g.*, the audacity that the patels and other elders ascribe to Saayamma for demanding the land that is rightfully hers. Another dimension of the conversation is the way Saayamma's attempts to uncover the truth are met by the elders, and how they treat her demands.

Saayamma's place in society and her family is also treated at places in the story. The story of her husband's funeral, as well as the intervention of her father and brothers in the dispute, tell us that she is respected among the Madiga and Baindla castes and looked at with affection by her near and dear ones.
