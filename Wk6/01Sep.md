# Readings (Prega News)
## Imagery (contd.)
The poem describes the plight of a woman who is hoping to have children, but is unable to; specifically, her sufferings under the scrutiny of a society which imposes an expectation to reproduce on its members.

The repeated metaphor of clouds is immediately noticeable – the first reference, in the beginning, draws on clouds as producers of rain, while the second one relies on clouds as a light, delicate entity. This latter usage parallels the "images of infants float[ing] across ... her eyes" – creating an ephemeral, dreamy quality.

The repeated theme of life – both flora and fauna – in the poem, both in positive and negative ways, is also significant.  Examples of the former include the references to squirrels, calves, and saplings, while those of the latter are the mentions of "a barren tree", and "a butterfly whose wings are severed". This may be considered ironic given that the desperation of a woman to produce life is the central idea in the poem.  
There is also a contrast between the idealised picture of motherhood painted by society, symbolised by the second stanza with its description of an idyllic scene with animals and their young, and the reality of a woman struggling to have children under this expectation.  
A third aspect of the motif of nature is the subtle suggestion that motherhood is the "natural" path for a woman, and that anything else is atypical. Society has normalised this idea, that womanhood is centred around reproduction, through culture and religion, and it is the source of a great deal of misery and humiliation for a woman who cannot bear children.

The harshness of the result of the pregnancy test is emphasised by the phrasing "a negative to her face". These words come soon after an abrupt shift in tone brought by the references to the "thorns of a cactus", which emphasise the suffering she is undergoing.  
The "frozen block of ice" she is described as also parallels the earlier references to a flowing river; deepening the pathos of the situation. The use of the word "reborn" implies that she dies every month at the negative result, and yet refuses to give up.

The wordplay between the two senses of *tearing* is also meaningful.

This work relies heavily on symbolism, painting pictures by descriptions of entities, without using unnecessary verbs. There are many ideas which are fundamentally abstract, but which are represented by concrete objects; for example, the "prayer gardens for kids" that represent her desire for children.

The last paragraph contains another implicit reference to society's image of ideal motherhood – the life of a woman ought to revolve around her children and their well-being. This notion parallels how much importance she is herself giving to bearing children. This relies on the idea that the absence of something gives value to its presence – similar to the concept of negative space in art. This woman's inability to have children emphasises society's idealisation of motherhood in women.

## Translation
We have seen in connection with Shyamala's work that academic and official Telugu is sanskritised and has an upper-cast, Andhra slant. Mercy Margaret's work, however, has elements of the Telugu of Telangana, her native dialect, rather than subscribing to an artificial "standard".

A number of phrases are also different in translation; for example, the phrases "and so she shuns society", "tears up on seeing that line", and "shivering like a butterfly with its wings severed" are literally "avoiding social gatherings", "seeing the line for the 60th time", and "writhing in pain like a butterfly sliced in half".

An example of an aspect lost in translation is the use of the word *pilla* in Telugu, which is a suffix to indicate the young of any animal. Thus the repeated references to animal young in the poem make use of this word, emphasising the lack of children of the woman. Reduplication of adjectives like *colourful* and *smoky* is also a literary device that does not carry over to English, which has a semantic connotation as well.

# Readings (Broken Love)
## About the Poet
Hoshang Merchant was born in a Parsi family in Bombay, and has lived in Hyderabad for the latter half of his life. He has taught English and written several books on poetry and a few on literary criticism. He is openly gay and has written about his experiences in *Yaarana – Gay Writing from India*. He described poetry as a "subterfuge in an era of proscription".

He makes extensive use of *enjambment*, the practice of leaving lines of poetry syntactically incomplete and without punctuation, forcing the reader to read the next line in continuity.

## Text
One possible reading of the description of broken love as *an intercepted message* is as a reference to the difficulty to move on after the end of a relationship (for instance). A person unable to move on from their attachment is neither with the person they want to be with, nor with anyone else – the way an intercepted message is neither with the sender nor with the intended recipient.  
The specific use of the word "message" indicates the reliance of love on communication, which has been broken, or in some way compromised.

The second stanza with its themes of lightness and emptiness may be conveying a listless manner on the part of a heartbroken person. It conveys themes of abandonment and loneliness. The feather "swirling" is a kind of circular, aimless movement.
