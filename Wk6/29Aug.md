# Readings (The Woman in Black)
## Story (contd.)
The way time passes is a theme throughout the story – it passes in a normal fashion inside the house, where the trial is going on, but outside it appears somewhat suspended. Evidences for this are the surgeon's reaction to the narrator touching the branches repeatedly, and the description of Nusrat (which gives the impression of her being almost a shadow).

The last paragraph also brings up the question of who the "woman in black" is. This is another level of mystery added by the translator (in the decision to change the title from *Nusrat*).

There is also a parallelism that runs through the story, where the two spaces (the courtyard and the interior) and the two woman mirror each other. There is also a parallel between the narrator's experience with the scraps of paper left over from the trial and the experience of the reader struggling with the story.

# Readings (Today I Say Unto Waris Shah)
## Translation
Translation from one language to another is an important topic in literature. Translated work stands by itself as a creative work, and has an independent existence (despite bearing, as it should, the mark of the source).

Translation always takes in place in a *hierarchy* between two languages, depending on the context. This hierarchy can be contested by pushing the reader to learn more and find out about the source culture and context – say, by leaving words like *burqa* or *sehra* untranslated.

## About the Poet
Amrita Pritam was a Punjabi poet and novelist who wrote in Punjabi and Hindi, and came to Delhi from Lahore as a partition refugee soon after her marriage. This was the context in which she wrote *Ajj Aakhaan Waris Shah Nu*, or *Today I Say Unto Waris Shah*, and the novel *Pinjar*, or *The Skeleton*.

Waris Shah was a Sufi poet of the 18th century, considered the first contemporary Punjabi poet. He is most known for his rendition of the legend of *Heer Ranjha*. Sufi poetry tends to be allegorical – for example, *Heer Ranjha* is a social critique of caste and class, as a challenge to social hierarchy and order.  
In this work, Waris Shah is a metonym for Punjabiyat.
