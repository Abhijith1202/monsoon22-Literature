# Readings (Today I Say Unto Waris Shah)
## Metaphor
[Abrams, p. 96-100 (figurative language)]

Waris Shah in this poem is a *metonym* (the literal term of one entity is used to refer to another, with which it has become closely associated) for *punjabiyat*, the shared, syncretic culture of Punjab. The poem here evokes Waris Shah to appeal to the people of Punjab to overcome their hatred and recall and rebuild the bonds of their community.

The reference to poison irrigating the land through the five rivers shows the depth of the change that has been wrought upon Punjab – it makes it clear that it is not a superficial, "landscape" change, but a fundamental change to the civilisation of the place.

The use of words like "mesmerised" and "gullible" paints the people of Punjab as victims rather than as the perpetrators of the violence – it views them as helpless, affected by something bigger at play in the situation. It strips the people of their agency and accountability for their actions. It parallels the defencelessness of the rivers, the land and the life, which are affected by the poison without being able to fight back.  
The bamboo shoots-turned-cobras are a metaphor, either for the subset of the people of Punjab who spread violence and hatred, or for the ideologies that spread in the people's minds. It is possible that the reference to "shoots" indicates the youth of the land, in case it refers to a set of people.  
Similarly, the blood seeping through the graves of the ancestors again emphasises the depth of the change, where the history of the land is defiled. This leverages the immense importance ascribed to history by South Asian communities in general. The graves may also be considered to represent the deaths of the people during the riots itself – even after death, they are not free from the poison. This shows how enduring and lasting the pain of Partition was.

It is possible that the long description of poison slowly spreading through the rivers, then the wind, then the flora, and finally the people, is meant to indicate the long history of hatred spreading gradually across the land, culminating in this calamity.  
However, this poem does not play the blame game. While it is made clear that the people of Punjab themselves are not at fault, the actual cause of the violence remains unassigned. Any reference to who is culpable is vague and imprecise, like the reference to the "someone" who has poured poison in the rivers, or the unidentified "villains" who move about as thieves.


The poem also has a thread of references to an idyllic, almost utopian view of Punjab, like the rural landscapes (which stands in contrast to the author's experience, fleeing between two cities). It emphasis community life and culture, through its aspects like the trinjan, the swings, the songs, and so on.

Women also play a prominent role throughout the poem, with the references to the "daughters of Punjab", the girls fleeing the trinjan, and the "princesses of the valley". The suffering and pain endured by these women today is equated to what Heer went through, forced to stay away from Ranjha by her family and her community.

## About the Poet
Mercy Margaret is a promising young Telugu poet, who was raised in a devout Catholic home in Hyderabad. Her work has been widely translated and has earned her the Sahitya Akademi Yuva Puraskar.

## Imagery
[Abrams, p. 121 (imagery)]

Imagery is a major factor in poetic meaning, structure and effect. An image is a mental picture ([तसव्वुर]{lang=hi}), described in words. Imagery is used to signify all the objects and qualities of sense perception (not necessarily visual) referred to in a literary work – it makes poetry concrete and visualisable.

For example, *The Red Wheelbarrow* by William Carlos Williams itself describes an image composed of many images. The way the poem is written, spread out and broken over several lines, makes us slow down and think about it, focusing on the importance of everyday objects.
